# Phase 1 Final Project- Harry Potter House Sorter

This is an application that allows the user to filter Harry Potter characters by house. When a house is selected, a list of the characters in that house will appear. Each character is clickable. When a character is clicked, more in-depth information will be displayed.

## Installation Instructions
* Fork and clone on github
* Open index.html in the browser

## Features
* Dropdown menu that displays the four Hogwarts houses
* Select house to display all characters from that house
* Hover over character to change text color
* Click character to change text color again and display a character card containing a photo, name, house, patronus, and ancestry
